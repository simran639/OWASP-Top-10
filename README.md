# OWASP-Top-10

This repository sums up my first step through web application security, the OWASP Top 10, combining the theoretical learning from LinkedIn Learning and hands-on labs from TryHackMe.

Goal: To understand, exploit, and mitigate the most critical web application vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios.
